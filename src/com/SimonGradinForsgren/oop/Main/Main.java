// TODO - IDEAS,
// TODO - 1 Sanity stat that kills you if it runs out.
// TODO - 2 Move things around so not everything is in Logic.
// TODO - 3 Trick encounter that just kill you like a prompt that's something like "do you wish to jump down the
// TODO -   well?" and if you say yes you just die since you jump down a well.
// TODO - 4 would be cool to add specialised death messages for each enemy.

//WARNING !!!!!! damage is very inconsistent and sometimes you or enemies only deal 0, I will work on this.
